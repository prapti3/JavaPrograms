Java features
---------------

1. Simple
         - Java is simple as it contains losts of APIs / libraries
    ex: 
           Arrays.sort(n);


2. Object oriented
        - Java is  object oriented (OO) as it supports all the OO features like objects
          classes, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism 

3. Robust
       - Robust means Strong
       - In Java we can develop robust application using Exception Handling which avoids 
          abnormal termination of application 

4. Platform independent
      
5. Interpreted
         - Java command is an interpreter
         - Java interpreter executes byte code line by line
         - Javac command is a compiler
         - java compiler converts java source code into byte code 

6. Portable
      - Java is portable since the size of respective data type is same on all platforms 

        c/c++
        -----
        size of int data type => 2 bytes on 32-bite/ 4 bytes on 64-bit OS

        Java
        -----
        size of int data type => 4 bytes on 32-bit/64-bit OS 


7. Secure


       c/c++
       -----
       A pointer is a variable which contains address of another variable 
       EX:
          int n = 10;
          int *p = &n;  // address of n variable 



8. Multithreaded
      - A thread is a light weight process under execution within a process
      - Multithreading is used to increase the performance of application 


9. Dynamic
     - Memory allocation for arrays. objects is done during runtime (dynamic)
     - Java is automatic garbage collection 


10. distributed
      - Distributed applications are used for the purpose of exchanging data from one  
          application to another
