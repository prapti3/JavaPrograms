Lecture 3
-----------------------

Java Introduction
--------------------

- Java is an object oriented programming lang developed by James Gosling at sun Microsystem
- sun microsystem is acquire by oracle corp in 2010


object oriented concepts/ features
------------------------------------
- object
-classes
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism


Object
-------
An object is a real time entity which has identity, state and behavior
   


Class
------
A class is a collection of data members and methods


ex: class person 
   {
      //data members
        int age;
        String name;
        float height;
     //methods
       eat(){...}
       walk(){...}
  }



age = 20; // error

The members (data members/methods) of the class are accessed using objects with dot(.) operators


Creating objects
----------------

Syntax
------
ClassName objName = new ClassName();


ex: 
   
Person p = new Person();  //p is an object of class Person
p.age = 20;
p.name = "Raj";
p.height = 5.6;
p.walk();
p.eat();
